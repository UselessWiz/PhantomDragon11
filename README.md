- Hi, I’m @PhantomSnake11, and I hate making profiles like this
- I’m interested in a bit of this and a bit of that, but mostly game development, music production related things and cybersecurity.
- I’m currently half learning C++ and SDL
- I also speak Python, which is my first choice for most programming
- I'm also somewhat interested in creating Discord Bots
